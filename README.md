Table 17:
Do your best to describe the following lines of code:

    line 17: private bool _isGrounded = true;
    This sets a member variable of type boolean to the value true 

    line 28: if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && _isGrounded)
    This line calls the method GetKeyDown() with the parameter KeyCode.Space to see if the space key was clicked and it checks if the isGrounded member variable is true.

    line 32:_isGrounded = false;
    This line changes the _isGrounded member variable to false

    Pt2. 

    I did rigid body for the cat and ball because those collide and i did istrigger for the goal because it examines if ball is in r out.

    I accidently put the istrigger on the ball because and it fell through the floor.

Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

The r,g,b variables are floats instead of ints because they derive from the color wheel going from 0 to 1. Bounce is an integer because it can only bounce once at a time and not like half a boucne. Every bounce is a full 'one' bounce. Step 4 part two had a missing semicolon at the end of the line - which is essential to execute the statment.
